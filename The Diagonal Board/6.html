	<h1 class = "mainhead">Adding The Diagonal Board</h1>
	<p class = "paragraph">

		In using the diagram, hopefully you noticed that <b>in every cable, every wire except for one is connected to
		a diagonal wire</b>. Why is this? Let's look at the <span class="code">&#947</span> (gamma, <span class="code">c</span>'s associated stecker variable) cable as an example.

		<br><br>

		The <span class="code">a</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#947</span> cable is hard-wired to the
		<span class="code">c</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable, since both of these wires
		represent the hypothesis that <span class="code">a</span> is steckered to <span class="code">c</span>.

		<br><br>

		The <span class="code">b</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#947</span> cable is hard-wired to the
		<span class="code">c</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#946</span> cable, since both of these wires
		represent the hypothesis that <span class="code">b</span> is steckered to <span class="code">c</span>.

		<br><br>

		The <span class="code">c</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#947</span> cable is hard-wired to... nothing?

		<br><br>

		This can be explained by considering the hypothesis that the wire represents. Powering of the
		<span class="code">c</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#947</span> cable represents the hypothesis that
		<span class="code">c</span> is steckered to <span class="code">c</span>, that is, <span class="code">c</span>
		is unsteckered (or self-steckered).

		<br><br>

		<b>All such wire's which aren't connected to the diagonal board are all those which represent a self-stecker hypothesis</b>.
		Such cases do not give us any information about other stecker variables, hence why they lack a connection
		to the diagonal board.
