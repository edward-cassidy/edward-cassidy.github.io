        The expanded menu diagram provides more detail about what is actually happening when the plaintext is encoded to the ciphertext.

        <br><br>

        Recall how the line labelled <span class="code">1</span> between <span class="code">b</span> and <span class="code">e</span> in the simple menu diagram means that
        <span class="code">b</span> was encoded to <span class="code">e</span> in the crib when the scramblers were in relative position (RSP) <span class="code">1</span>.

        <br><br>

        Thinking back to <em>Chapter 2: Enigma Recap</em>, we will consider in more detail how <span class="code">b</span> is encoded to <span class="code">e</span>,
        although this time from our new codebreaker perspective.
