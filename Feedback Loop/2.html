        <p class="paragraph">
            Ideally we would like to be able to simultaneously scan every value for <span class="code">&#945</span> at the same time, instead of checking them one by one like before.
            <br><br>

            So far we have two cases:

            <br>
        </p>

        <ol class = "paragraph" style="list-style-position: inside;">
            <li>When we input a value for <span class="code">&#945</span>, say <span class="code">X</span>, the Bombe outputs the same value <span class="code">&#945</span>.<br>
                This means our guess that  <span class="code">&#945</span> =  <span class="code">X</span> may possibly be correct.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>When we input a value for <span class="code">&#945</span>, say <span class="code">X</span>, the Bombe outputs some value other than <span class="code">X</span>, say <span class="code">Y</span>.<br>
                This means our guess that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">X</span> is definitely incorrect.
            </li>
         </ol>

        <p class="paragraph">
            <br>
            Now, due to the reciprocal nature of the Enigma encryption, we also know <span class="code">&#945</span> cannot take on the value <span class="code">Y</span>.

            <br><br>

            Now let's try doing something very strange: what if we re-input <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">Y</span> into the Bombe?

            <br><br>

            This may seem silly: why make input a value for <span class="code">&#945</span> that we know is definitely incorrect?

            <br><br>

            However, consider that the further value for <span class="code">&#945</span> that we derive from setting <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">Y</span>,
            say <span class="code">Z</span>, we now know to also be incorrect.

            <br><br>

            We can continue to repeat this, and by process of elimination, rule out many incorrect values for <span class="code">&#945</span>.

        </p>
