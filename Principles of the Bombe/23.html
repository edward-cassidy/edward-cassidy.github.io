    <p class = "paragraph">

        Well... yes and no.

        <br><br>

        The process we used to derive conclusions about stecker variables is, in fact, perfectly sound. So we did nothing wrong there.

        <br><br>

        So there is actually only one place left that the problem could originate from: <b>one or both of our assumptions were incorrect</b>.
        We can't say which assumption was incorrect from this contradiction alone, but what we can say is:

        <br><br>

        <b>"For the assumed initial scrambler positions, <span class="code">a</span> cannot be steckered to <span class="code">b</span></b>."

        <br><br>

        So finally, we have the conditions for an <b>invalid steckering</b> based on the menu, for a given initial scrambler position.

        <br><br>

        Specifically, we assumed the initial scrambler positions and steckering we wanted to rule out
        (in this case assuming that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span>), and then <b>used a <u>cycle</u> in the menu</b>
        in order to re-derive the value of <span class="code">&#945</span>. We then observed that the new value we found is not the same as
        the one we originally assumed (which we call a contradiction).
