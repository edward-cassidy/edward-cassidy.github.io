        One aid is through intelligence about trends in German messages.

        <br><br>

        For example, the British operators may have known that the Germans would send a weather report every morning at a particular time.
        Therefore, they could guess that the first messages of the day would contain “weather report” (Wetterbericht in German).

        <br><br>

        This was further aided by a crucial error in the design of Enigma machines: <b>it could not encode a letter to itself</b>.

        <br><br>

        This can be exploited to more easily and accurately determine the position of the crib in the ciphertext, as we will see in the next page.
