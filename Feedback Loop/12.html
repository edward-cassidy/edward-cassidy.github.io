            One solution is to find better cribs, whose menus have multiple cycles in them which will increase feedback, and reduce chances of false stops.

            <br><br>

            However, the codebreakers only have so much information to work with to deduce cribs, and finding such
            complex cribs is fairly difficult.

            <br><br>

            This is where the final extension of the Bombe is introduced in the final chapter, which solves the need for a perfect menu.
