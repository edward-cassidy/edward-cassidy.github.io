    <h1 class = "mainhead">Setup</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        When setting up the Enigma machine, the operator must <b>select three scramblers to use from a choice of five</b>
        (which are aptly named scramblers <span class="code">I</span>, <span class="code">II</span>, <span class="code">III</span>, <span class="code">IV</span>, and <span class="code">V</span>).
        Each of these five 'standard' scramblers has different internal wiring, although every '<span class="code">I</span>' scrambler has the same internal
        wiring as every other '<span class="code">I</span>' scrambler that is produced, and so on.
        The operator must also <b>choose an order</b> in which to insert these three scramblers.

        <br><br>

        The operator must also <b>select a reflector from a choice of two</b>: reflector <span class="code">B</span> or
        reflector <span class="code">C</span> (although a fourth reflector <span class="code">D</span> was also used towards the end of WW2).
        The reflector is inserted to the left of the three chosen scramblers, with the metal contacts facing the left-most scrambler.

        <br><br>

        When inserted, the contacts on adjacent scramblers and the reflector rub against each other. Critically, the scramblers
        (but not the reflector) can be each independently rotated to any of 26 positions.

        <br><br>

        Before typing a message, the operator must rotate the scramblers to some <b>initial position</b>.
        The edges of the scramblers are labelled with letters from <span class="code">A</span> to <span class="code">Z</span>, so the desired initial scrambler position
        is specified by a three-letter code, such as <em>ABC</em>. (Technically the operator sets the ring settings
        before the initial rotor positions, but that is beyond the scope of this recap).
