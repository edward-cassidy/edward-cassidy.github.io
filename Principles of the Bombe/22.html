        The eagle-eyed reader may have noticed the problem we've run into.

        <br><br>

        We started off by assuming an initial scrambler position, and that <b><span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span></b>.

        <br><br>

        Based on these assumptions we just concluded that <b><span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">h</span></b>.

        <br><br>

        The assumption <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span> tells us that <b><span class="code">a</span> is steckered to <span class="code">b</span></b>,
        but the conclusion <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">h</span> tells us that <b><span class="code">a</span> is instead steckered to <span class="code">h</span></b>!

        <br><br>

        This is problematic, as there is only one <span class="code">a</span> socket in the plugboard, so <b><span class="code">a</span> can only be steckered
        to one other letter</b>. In other words, <b>the stecker variable <span class="code">&#945</span> cannot be equal to multiple values simultaneously</b>.

        <br><br>

        So what gives? Did we do something wrong?
