        Firstly, as <span class="code">b</span> is pressed, the fast scrambler rotates by one position, so that the relative scrambler position is now <span class="code">1</span>.

        <br><br>

        Secondly, the plugboard will potentially swap <span class="code">b</span> to some other, as of yet unknown letter
        (unknown, since we don’t yet know which sockets are connected by stecker cables).
        We will call this unknown output letter <span class="code">&#946</span> (the Greek letter beta). Here, <b><span class="code">&#946</span> is acting as a variable</b> -
        we know it takes on the value of some other letter between <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">h</span> (or <span class="code">a</span> to <span class="code">z</span> for a full Enigma machine), but we don’t yet know which letter specifically.
        Note that if <span class="code">b</span> is self-steckered, then <span class="code">&#946</span> will take on the value <span class="code">b</span>.

        <br><br>

        Then, <span class="code">&#946</span> is sent to the scramblers, where it emerges as some necessarily different letter.
        As we don’t know the true value of <span class="code">&#946</span>, we also cannot know the letter that the scramblers output.
        Therefore, we will again create a variable to represent this unknown, this time <span class="code">&#949</span> (the Greek letter epsilon).

        <br><br>

        Finally, <span class="code">&#949</span> is sent to the plugboard. However, this time we know what the output will be,
        since the output of the plugboard here marks the end of the encoding process, and we know from the crib that at RSP <span class="code">1</span>, <span class="code">b</span> is encoded to <span class="code">e</span>.
        Therefore <span class="code">&#949</span> is transformed to <span class="code">e</span> by the plugboard, and a light labelled <span class="code">e</span> is then lit up on the Enigma machine.
