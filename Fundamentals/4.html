    <p class="paragraph">
        The Bombe used a technique called a <b>probable phrase attack</b>.

        <br><br>

        This is where the code breakers guess that a portion of the ciphertext was encoded from some particular plaintext, which is what we will call a <b>crib</b>.
        If their guess is correct, they can then use that to break the rest of the message.

        <br><br>

        So if the code breakers were to intercept a long portion of ciphertext which contained the characters <span class="code">egffbhg</span>,
        they might guess that this was originally <span class="code">babbage</span>.

        <br><br>

        But is it ever possible to make accurate guesses?
