    <h1 class = "mainhead">Operation: The Plugboard</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        After the fast scrambler (and possibly one or both of the other scramblers) have rotated,
        an <b>electrical current</b> is sent <b>through the <span class="code">a</span> wire</b> to the <b>plugboard</b>.

        <br><br>

        If there is no cable attached to the <span class="code">a</span> socket in the plugboard, then
        the <span class="code">a</span> wire simply <b>continues onto the scramblers</b>.

        <br><br>

        Suppose instead that there is a stecker cable plugged in between the <span class="code">a</span> socket and the <span class="code">b</span> socket.
        In this case, power travels <b>along this stecker cable</b> and <b>into the <span class="code">b</span> wire</b>,
        before being sent to the <b>scramblers</b>. Effectively, the <b><span class="code">a</span> keypress has been swapped to a <span class="code">b</span> keypress</b>.
