	<h1 class = "mainhead">Increasing Feedback</h1>
	<p class = "paragraph">

		The idea was the brain child of <b>Gordon Welchman</b>, and the logic goes as follows:

		<br><br>

		You should now be familiar with the idea that saying "<span class="code">a</span> is steckered to <span class="code">b</span>"
		is completely synonymous to saying "<b><span class="code">b</span> is steckered to <span class="code">a</span>"</b>.
		That is, <b>we cannot have one without the other</b>, since they both refer to the same setting on the Enigma machine
		(the presence of a stecker cable between the <span class="code">a</span> and <span class="code">b</span> sockets in the plugboard).

		<br><br>

		We also know by now, that when the <span class="code">b</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable is powered
		this means that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span>.
		We also know that this represents the assumption or conclusion that "<span class="code">a</span> is steckered to <span class="code">b</span>"

		<br><br>

		Furthermore, when the <span class="code">a</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#946</span> cable is powered
		this means that <span class="code">&#946</span> = <span class="code">a</span>.
		This represents the assumption or conclusion that "<span class="code">b</span> is steckered to <span class="code">a</span>"

		<br><br>

		But we just reasoned that "<span class="code">b</span> is steckered to <span class="code">a</span>" and
		"<span class="code">b</span> is steckered to <span class="code">a</span>" are synonymous.
		So for a valid steckering we will never have the <span class="code">b</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable being powered
		without the <span class="code">a</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#946</span> cable also being powered.

		<br><br>

		The grand idea, therefore, is to <b>hard-wire an electrical connection</b> between the <span class="code">b</span>
		wire of the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable, and the <span class="code">a</span> wire of the <span class="code">&#946</span> cable.
		We will add connections between all such equivalent pairs of wires which represent the same steckering.

		<br><br>

		The wires we will add are collectively referred to as the <b>diagonal board</b>. We will see over the page
		why it was given this name...
