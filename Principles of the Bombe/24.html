        It therefore turns out that the fact our menu has a cycle in it was vital to ruling out a possible steckering.

        <br><br>

        That being said, if we were to instead travel around the cycle and find again that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span> (so there is no contradiction),
        then this still <b>doesn't mean our assumptions are correct</b>.

        <br><br>

        The only thing we can say is that <b>we cannot prove the assumptions are incorrect</b>.

        <br><br>

        It is also worth noting that our choice to make assumptions about the stecker variable <span class="code">&#945</span>
        was completely arbitrary. For example, we could have instead made an assumption about the value of <span class="code">&#950</span>,
        and then used the loop between <span class="code">&#950</span> and <span class="code">&#946</span>.
