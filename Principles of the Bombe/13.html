        We will first clarify what information and resources we have access to along with the crib:

        <br><br>

        Let’s say we know which scramblers were used to encode the crib (for example scramblers <span class="code">I</span>, <span class="code">II</span>, <span class="code">IV</span>, and reflector <span class="code">B</span>),
        and the order in which they were installed in the Enigma machine.

        <br><br>

        Let's also say we have physical copies of these scramblers, and that we can manually pass a character through them to see an output.

        <br><br>

        Lets say we don’t, however, know their initial positions.
        Therefore, as discussed before, we will need to search through every possible initial scrambler position.
