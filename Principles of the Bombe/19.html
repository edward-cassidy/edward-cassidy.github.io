    <p class = "paragraph">

        This process can continue, but the overall idea is as follows:

        <br><br>

        Firstly we <b>assume an initial scrambler position</b>.

        <br><br>

        Secondly we <b>assume the value of a single stecker variable in the menu</b>.

        <br><br>

        Finally, based on these assumptions, we can <b>conclude the value of any other stecker variable in the menu</b>,
        given we know which scramblers were used, and have a working copy of them to perform scrambling operations.

        <br><br>

        We still haven't shown why making assumptions, which are most likely incorrect, and deriving conclusions from them
        is at all useful. This is the topic of the next slides.
