        The original design was produced by <b>Alan Turing</b> at Bletchley Park, with a later design improvement
        by <b>Gordon Welchman</b> drastically improving the machine's performance. However, this design had remained
        a mystery since the war, until 1974, when the security embargo surrounding activities at Bletchley Park was lifted.

        <br><br>

        However, since all the original Bombes were scrapped over a period of a few years after the war,
        it was not until 1995 when GCHQ released the engineering drawings of the Bombe to the Bletchley Park Trust,
        that its underlying electronic and mechanical design could be fully determined.
