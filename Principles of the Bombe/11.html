        It is very important to note that the encryption performed by an Enigma machine is <b>reciprocal</b>.

        <br><br>

        That means if we were to press <span class="code">e</span> instead of <span class="code">b</span> when at RSP <span class="code">0</span>,
        then the fast rotor would rotate so that we are now at RSP <span class="code">1</span>,
        then current would flow through the Enigma mechanism exactly in reverse compared to before,
        and we would receive an output of <span class="code">b</span>.

        <br><br>

        This is, in fact, how a German recipient would decode a message â€“
        if you know the initial setup of the Enigma machine used to encode a message (which they would have, using a book of daily Enigma settings),
        then they could set up their machine in the same way as the sender, before typing in the ciphertext.
        The resulting output will be the plaintext initially encoded by the sender.
