    <h1 class = "mainhead">Operation: The Scramblers</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        All of the 26 <span class="code">a</span> to <span class="code">z</span> wires that exit from the plugboard arrive on the <b>right-hand side</b> of the scramblers.
        Each of these wires makes contact with a <b>different metal contact</b> on right side of the fast scrambler.

        <br><br>

        Electrical current then passes <b>through each scrambler</b> in turn from <b>right to left</b> until it reaches the <b>reflector</b>.

        <br><br>

        Recall that the reflector only has metal contacts on the right-hand side, which are paired in some arbitrary configuration.
        This means that when current enters the reflector on its right-hand side, it comes back out on the same side, but from a different metal contact.
        Current then travels back through the scramblers, but this time from <b>left to right</b>.

        <br><br>

        Electrical current emerges from some wire on the <b>right-hand</b> side of the scramblers, although a necessarily
        different wire from the input to the scramblers. The input letter has therefore been <em>scrambled</em> by the scramblers.

        <br><br>

        Note that as the scramblers rotate with each keypress, pressing the same key multiple times in a row will yield
        <b>different outputs</b> for each keypress from the Enigma machine.
