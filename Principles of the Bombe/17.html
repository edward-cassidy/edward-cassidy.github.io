    <h1 class = "mainhead">Assumptions and Implications</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        This process is repetitive:

        <br><br>

        We know from the expanded menu diagram, that <b>at RSP <span class="code">1</span>, <span class="code">&#946</span> is scrambled to <span class="code">&#949</span></b>.
        Also recall that we just concluded that <b><span class="code">&#946</span> = <span class="code">d</span></b>.

        <br><br>

        Therefore, letâ€™s <b>set the scramblers to the guessed initial position</b>, <b>rotate the fast scrambler by one</b>
        (so that we are now in RSP <span class="code">1</span>), then <b>pass <span class="code">d</span> through the scramblers</b>.

        <br><br>

        Suppose we <b>receive an output of <span class="code">f</span></b>.
        We therefore conclude that <b><span class="code">&#949</span> = <span class="code">f</span></b>, since this is the very definition
        of the stecker variable <span class="code">&#949</span>.

        <br><br>

        This means that <b>still only based on our two assumptions</b>, we have now concluded that <span class="code">&#946</span> must take on the value <span class="code">d</span>,
        and also that <span class="code">&#949</span> must take on the value <span class="code">f</span>.

    </p>
