            Due to this new feedback, we can gauge a lot more information about the accuracy of our guess based on the number of live wires.
            <br><br>
            Say we power on the <span class="code">b</span> wire in the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable, as we have done previously.
            Here is what we can deduce, depending on the number of live wires in the test register:
            <br>
        </p>

        <div style="margin:auto;width: 1000px">
            <ul class = "paragraph" style="list-style-position: inside;text-align: left;margin:auto">
                <a><b>Case 1:</b></a>
                <li style="text-align: center">Only the <span class="code">b</span> wire is live. This means that there was no contradiction,
                    and it is possible that we correctly guessed the initial scrambler position and value of <span class="code">&#945</span>.
                </li>
                <br>
                <a><b>Case 2:</b></a>
                <li style="text-align: center">More than one wire is live, but not all of them. This is a contradiction,
                    since <span class="code">&#945</span> cannot take multiple values. So for the assumed initial scrambler positions,
                    none of the values for <span class="code">&#945</span> indicated by live wires are valid. <br>
                    However, some of the remaining values for <span class="code">&#945</span> may still be valid. In particular,
                    if there is exactly one wire in the <span class="code">&#945</span> cable which is not live,
                    then the letter represented by this wire is definitely valid value for <span class="code">&#945</span> for the assumed scrambler position
                    (this is essentially the complement of case 1).
                </li>
                <br>
                <a><b>Case 3:</b></a>
                <li style="text-align: center">All wires become live. This is a contradiction, and there is no valid value for <span class="code">&#945</span>
                    for the assumed initial scrambler positions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            Case 3 is the most important case for the operation of the Bombe, as we can completely rule out the assumed initial scrambler position
            if this case occurs.
