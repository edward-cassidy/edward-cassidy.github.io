            The machine we have built now allows you to input an initial guess for the value of <span class="code">&#945</span>
            and automatically see the implied value of <span class="code">&#945</span> after using a loop in the menu.

            <br><br>

            Of course, the machine we implemented is tailored to our specific menu, so for other menus, a different number
            of scramblers will need to be connected between different pairs of cables, depending on the loop present in the menu.

            <br><br>

            In the next page is a simple simulator of the Bombe we have developed so far, tailored to our menu.

            <br><br>

            Can you find any non-contradictions? How quickly does it become tedious work...?
