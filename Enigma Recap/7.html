    <h1 class = "mainhead">Operation: Input and Scrambler Rotation</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        Now that the plugboard and scramblers are set up to their desired positions, the Enigma operator can encode a message.
        (although actual protocol for sending a message was more complicated than this).

        <br><br>

        When a key is pressed on the Enigma machine, say the <span class="code">a</span> key, the first thing that happens is <b>the scrambler
        on the far-right rotates by one step</b> (so if it was previously in position <span class="code">A</span>, it is now in position <span class="code">B</span>).

        <br><br>

        For every <b>full rotation</b> the far-right scrambler makes, the middle scrambler will rotate by one, and similarly for
        the far-left scrambler (although not exactly, as the true mechanism for the far-left scrambler's rotation
        is slightly more complicated and unintuitive). Due to how often each scrambler rotates, the far-right scrambler is often called the
        <b>fast rotor</b>, and the far-left the <b>slow rotor</b>.

        <br><br>

        It should be noted that the next scrambler doesn't necessarily rotate when the previous scrambler rotates from <span class="code">Z</span> back to <span class="code">A</span>.
        In fact, the timing of these turnovers is what the <b>ring settings</b> define (which, again, are out of the scope of this recap).
