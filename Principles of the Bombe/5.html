        This highlights how the number of ways the plug board can be set up dwarfs the number of possible initial scrambler positions.

        <br><br>

        Our method will therefore involve trying every possible initial scrambler position in turn, and for each, ruling out steckerings which are <b>invalid with respect to the menu</b>.

        <br><br>

        What constitutes an <em>invalid</em> steckering will be discussed throughout the chapter.
        However, our overall goal is to find a method of ruling out steckerings that is so strong,
        that across all 17576 initial scrambler positions, <b>almost all possible steckerings are ruled out as invalid</b>.

        <br><br>

        We can then check the remaining candidates by hand, one of which will hopefully be the correct solution
        (unless the scrambler order was wrong, in which case no valid steckering will be found).
