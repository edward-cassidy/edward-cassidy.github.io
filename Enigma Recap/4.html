        The scramblers are somewhat more complicated than the plugboard.

        <br><br>

        A scrambler by itself is a <b>disk that looks rather like a cog</b>. On both flat sides of the scrambler, there is
        a <b>ring of 26 metal contacts</b> (see <em>Figure 2.3</em>). Each metal contact on one side is <b>electronically connected</b> to exactly
        one metal contact on the other side. Around the circumference are written the letters of the alphabet, each
        which lines up with a different contact.

        <br><br>

        Fundamentally, the contacts are not connected in a straight line through the scrambler,
        rather they are <em>scrambled up</em> based on a <b>mess of internal wiring</b>.
