    <h1 class = "mainhead">Reduced Alphabet</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        As discussed previously, we will be considering a Bombe with a reduced alphabet size of only the first 8 letters.

        <br><br>

        However the explanations here are valid for any alphabet size. An Enigma capable of working with only the letters
        <span class="code">a</span> to <span class="code">h</span> would be exactly the same, except there would only be 8 input buttons, 8 output lamps,
        8 plugboard sockets, a maximum of four stecker cables, and each scrambler would only have 8 metal contacts.
