    <p class = "paragraph">

        In <em>Chapter 2: Enigma Recap</em> we reminded ourselves of the method by which an Enigma machine
        encodes plaintext into ciphertext.

        <br><br>

        In <em>Chapter 3: Fundamentals</em> we introduced the idea of a <b>probable phrase attack</b>,
        and how we can deduce the position of the theorised <b>plaintext</b> within the intercepted <b>ciphertext</b>.

        <br><br>

        Letâ€™s now consider how an Enigma machine encodes plaintext to ciphertext <b>from our perspective as codebreakers</b>,
        not knowing how the Enigma machine was initially set up before the crib was encoded.

        <br><br>

        We will use the same example where we theorise <span class="code">babbage</span> is the plaintext, which was encoded to the ciphertext <span class="code">egffbhg</span>.
