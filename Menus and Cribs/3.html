    <h1 class = "mainhead">Relative Scrambler Positions (RSPs)</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        Before the <span class="code">babbage</span> was typed in by the Enigma operator, the scramblers of the Enigma machine were in
        some currently unknown initial positions â€“ it is our job to determine these
        <b>initial scrambler positions</b> during the decryption process.

        <br><br>

        Furthermore, remember that for each letter of the plaintext the Enigma operator types in, the fast scrambler is rotated by one position,
        and that it is also possible for the middle or slow scramblers to turnover as well.

        <br><br>

        However, we will now assume that during the course of typing in the crib plaintext, that neither the middle, nor slow rotors turned over.
        This is actually a requirement for the Bombe to work, which naturally restricts the use of the Bombe to only certain cribs.
        We will continue to assume that there are no <b>middle wheel turnovers</b> for the entirety of the guide.
