            So far, we have only used the cycle from the menu, but it is also useful to add in all the connections from the menu, not just the ones in the cycle.

            <br><br>

            In our earlier example which only added four scrambler assemblies to the bombe, it meant that the <span class="code">&#952</span> cable was never connected
            to any other cable, so never had a chance to be connected.

            <br><br>

            However if we add the missing connection to <span class="code">&#952</span>, the Bombe can actually help rule out
            values of <span class="code">&#952</span>, as well as the variable we are testing, <span class="code">&#945</span>.
