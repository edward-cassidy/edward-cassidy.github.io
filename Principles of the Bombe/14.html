    <h1 class = "mainhead">Assumptions and Implications</h1>
    <p class = "paragraph">

        We will now make two <b>two guesses about how the Enigma machine was set up</b> when the crib was encoded.

        <br><br>

        We will then <b>assume that these guesses are correct</b>, even though they are <em>very</em> likely to be wrong.
        We therefore call these two guesses our <b>assumptions</b>.

        <br><br>

        Unless you are familiar with mathematical proof by contradiction, then making these assumptions may seem like a very confusing thing
        to do, but it will become clear soon enough why making these assumptions is useful.

        <br><br>

        Our first guess is to arbitrarily choose some <b>initial scrambler position</b>.

        <br><br>

        Our second guess is to arbitrarily choose a <b>steckering for one of the letters in the menu</b>.
        In this case, we will guess that <span class="code">a</span> is steckered to <span class="code">b</span>, that is,
        the stecker variable <span class="code">&#945</span> takes on the value <span class="code">b</span>.

        <br><br>

        Remember that we now assume that both of these guesses are correct, even though, in reality, this is likely not the case.
