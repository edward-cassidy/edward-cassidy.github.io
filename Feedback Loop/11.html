            As mentioned previously, it is possible to have <b>false stops</b>, where there is no valid steckering
            for the assumed initial rotor position exists, but not all of the wires in the test register become live,
            so the Bombe must still stop. The operator must then spend time checking the stop, so the number of false sotps
            must be limited.

            <br><br>

            How can re reduce the number of false stops?

            <br><br>

            The issue is there is due to a lack of connectivity, where the process of elimination isn't (yet) powerful enough
            to make enough contradictions to rule out all possible steckerings.
