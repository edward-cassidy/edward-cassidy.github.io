		The addition of the diagonal board marks the end of the design of the Bombe, and therefore the end of this guide.

		<br><br>

		We highly recommend you try out our interactive Bombe simulator. It is complete with a <em>menu generator</em>,
		which enables you to generate ciphertext from <em>A-H</em> plaintext, visualise its menu,
		and then automatically set up the Bombe ready to crack it (or why not try setting up the Bombe to crack it yourself!).

		<br><br>

		The Bombe can then be used to search for a possibly valid initial rotor position, as well as letting you explore
		the circuit by powering wires on and observing to which wires current reaches.
