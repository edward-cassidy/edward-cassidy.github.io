        The concepts in this chapter form the basis of how we work out how the Enigma machine was initially set up,
        before the crib was encoded. Once we have worked this out, we can then decrypt the rest of the ciphertext
        using these settings.

        <br><br>

        Currently, we have to assume every possible initial scrambler position in turn, and for each, determine
        which steckerings for a given letter in the crib are valid.

        <br><br>

        Supposing we chose to test <span class="code">a</span>, we would have to set <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">a</span>, then <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span>,
        then <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">c</span>, ... and so on until <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">h</span>. We don't need to try any letters
        other than <span class="code">a</span>, since if we can't find any valid steckering for <span class="code">a</span>, then there cannot be
        any way to set up the plug board given the assumed initial scrambler position.

        <br><br>

        Hopefully, we will find that <b>most pairs of assumptions lead to a contradiction</b>, so the <b>remaining
        few can be tested by hand</b>. However, how many contradictions we find depends on factors such as the number of
        cycles in the menu, so there is still somewhat of a factor of chance that our crib produces a strong menu.
