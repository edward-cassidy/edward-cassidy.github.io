    <p class = "paragraph">

        This next part is a lot to take in. There is also a visual description over the page.

        <br><br>

        We know from the expanded menu diagram, that <b>at RSP <span class="code">5</span>, <span class="code">&#945</span> is scrambled to <span class="code">&#946</span></b>.
        We also have made an assumption about the <b>initial scrambler positions</b>, as well as guessing that <b><span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span></b>.
        Remember that we also have physical copies of the scramblers to hand.

        <br><br>

        Therefore, letâ€™s <b>set up these scramblers and rotate them to the guessed initial position</b>, then <b>rotate the fast scrambler forwards five positions</b>
        (so that we are now at RSP <span class="code">5</span>), then <b>pass <span class="code">b</span> through the scramblers</b>.

        <br><br>

        Suppose we <b>receive an output of <span class="code">d</span></b>.
        We therefore conclude that <b><span class="code">&#946</span> = <span class="code">d</span></b>, since this is the very definition
        of the stecker variable <span class="code">&#946</span>.

        <br><br>

        This means that <b>based on our two assumptions</b>, we can conclude that <span class="code">&#946</span> must take on the value <span class="code">d</span>.
