        Secondly, we want to determine the <b>stecker swaps</b> used by the machine.

        <br><br>

        Recall that a real Enigma machine had <b>10 stecker leads</b>. This leads to a total of <b>150,738,274,937,250 combinations</b> of stecker swaps to choose from.

        <br><br>

        That said, it is not strictly necessary to directly determine all the stecker swaps.
        Rather if we can find a majority, then the remaining swaps can be determined by eye when decrypting
        the intercepted message (specifically, the stecker swaps we can directly determine depends on how much of the alphabet the menu covers â€“
        it is in fact common that a few remaining steckers can only be found by eye).
