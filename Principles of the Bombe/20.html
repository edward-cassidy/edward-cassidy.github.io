        Letâ€™s continue where we left off with regard to solving for stecker variables.

        <br><br>

        At RSP <span class="code">7</span>, <span class="code">&#949</span> is scrambled to <span class="code">&#951</span>.
        Passing <span class="code">&#949</span> = <span class="code">f</span> (which we concluded previously) through the scramblers
        set up in this position tells us that <b><span class="code">&#951</span> = <span class="code">c</span></b>.

        <br><br>

        At RSP <span class="code">2</span>, <span class="code">&#951</span> is scrambled to <span class="code">&#945</span>.
        Passing <span class="code">&#951</span> = <span class="code">c</span> (which we concluded just now) through the scramblers
        set up in this position tells us that <b><span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">h</span></b>.

        <br><br>

        Notice anything strange...?
