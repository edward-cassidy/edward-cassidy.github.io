            In the next page we will connect the rest of the scramblers corresponding each of the edges in the menu on the cycle.

            <br><br>

            It's important to remember that each of the scrambler, will need to be in their corresponding relative scrambler position, as denoted by the labels on the edges of the menu.

            <br><br>

            Therefore, a scrambler with a RSP of 4 will be 3 positions ahead of a scrambler with RSP 1.
