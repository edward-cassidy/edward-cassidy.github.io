            As shown in the previous chapter, the method works by deriving contradictions.

            <br><br>

            We guessed that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">b</span> and found that this implied that <span class="code">&#945</span> = <span class="code">h</span>,
            which we reasoned is not possible. We would then move on to guessing <span class="code">&#945</span> being another letter, having ruled out <span class="code">b</span>.
            We continue to do this, until we find a letter that doesn't derive a contradiction,
            or we have exhausted all possibilities, at which point we move onto trying a new initial scrambler position.

            <br><br>

            However, remember that even when we do find a letter that doesn't cause a contradiction, this still doesn't mean it is correct,
            and further examination needs to be carried out.

            <br><br>

            <b>We can see why this takes so long.</b>

            <br><br>

            Therefore we want to <b>design a machine</b> which allows us to input a value for <span class="code">&#945</span>, and return the implied, possibly contradictory <span class="code">&#945</span> value
            found by traveling around the loop in the menu. We can then check ourselves if the output matches up or not.

            <br><br>

            Note that we chose <span class="code">a</span> as our central letter in the menu to test. However, this choice was mostly arbitrary, and we could have equally chosen any
            other letter in the menu. However, since we are going through a fixed example, we will continue to test the stecker variable <span class="code">&#945</span>.
