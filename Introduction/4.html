    <p class = "paragraph">

        This website aims to be a <b>comprehensive guide to understanding the underlying principles behind the bombe's
        design</b>.

        <br><br>

        We explain the <b>transformation of these principles into the electromechanical mechanism that
        drives the bombe</b>, in the form of <b>interactive circuit-diagrams outlining the internal wiring</b>.

        <br><br>

        Due to the complexity of the Turing-Welchman Bombe, we will be considering a <b>reduced bombe</b> for the course
        of this guide. The original Enigma machine and Bombe uses all 26 letters of the alphabet, however in our examples,
        we will only use the first 8 for simplicity. That being said, the principles discussed directly translate to
        the operation of the full bombe.

        <br><br>

        The guide is complete with a <b>fully-functional Bombe simulator built from those same circuit-diagrams</b>.

        <br><br>

        We hope you enjoy!
