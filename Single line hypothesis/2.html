            We have now introduced the main principles of how the Bombe works, however there is a significant problem with it: <br><br>

            <b>It is too slow.</b>

            <br><br>

            We would never be able to decipher the messages fast enough if we were to attempt to carry out this method by hand.

            <br><br>

            This is where the Bombe comes into play. Instead of having humans manually perform this process, <b>we have a machine do the work instead.</b>

            <br><br>

            In simple terms we are going to recreate the menu diagram, but instead using electrical wiring.
            We will build the Bombe itself up in these next three chapters.
            Only in the final chapter will we have a final version of the true Bombe.
