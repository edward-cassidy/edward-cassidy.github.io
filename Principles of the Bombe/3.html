    <p class = "paragraph">

        Firstly, we want to determine the <b>absolute initial scrambler positions</b>, that is,
        the actual position of the scramblers before the crib was encoded, not the relative positions.

        <br><br>

        For a real Enigma machine where each scrambler has 26 positions, there are <b>17576 possible initial scrambler
        positions</b> the Enigma operator can choose from.

        <br><br>

        However, we may not know which scramblers were used by the Enigma.

        <br><br>

        Remember that M3 Enigma had a total of <b>5 different scramblers to choose from</b> (labelled by roman numerals),
        as well as a <b>choice of two reflectors</b> (ignoring reflector <span class="code">D</span>).
        The Bombe can only try one combination of scramblers at a time, so the Bombe run may need to be <b>repeated up to
        120 times</b> before the correct scrambler order is found, or we realise that our guess for the crib was incorrect!

        <br><br>

        Hopefully, however, British intelligence will already have some idea which scramblers were used, so the number
        of scrambler orders to try is often significantly fewer than 120.
