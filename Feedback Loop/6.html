            Therefore, in the real Bombe it was designed as follows.

            <br><br>

            The operator would set it up as we have shown, using the menu to find a cycle, and connecting the relevant scramblers to the cables.

            <br><br>

            The operator would then somewhat arbitrarily choose stecker variable to be the test register (for example <span class="code">&#945</span>),
            and a value for that variable to take (for example <span class="code">b</span>).

            <br><br>

            The machine would then send a current through the chosen wire of the test register,
            and if all the wires in the test register become live (case 3), it rules out this initial scrambler position as being possible,
            and it automatically continues to try the next scrambler position.

            <br><br>

            The Bombe only stops when less not all of the wires in the test register are activated, which is why the choice of
            input wire are largely arbitrary (as in this case, making any of the wires live makes all the other wires live).

            <br><br>

            When the Bombe stops, an operator can then examine which wires are live in the test register,
            and proceed to manually determine whether this was a <b>false stop</b> or not.
