		Everything we have seen so far is great in theory. However, the chances of a menu having enough cycles
		to produce a small number of Bombe stops is, in practice, too low for the Bombe to be reliably useful
		at breaking Enigma messages.

		<br><br>

		Luckily enough a refinement can be made to the bombe, which drastically increases the amount of feedback.
		The method is so effective that a menu doesn't even necessarily require any cycles in it in order to
		produce a minimal number of stops (for example between one and four stops per rotor order).
